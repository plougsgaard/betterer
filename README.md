#  Betterer
[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://standardjs.com/)

This is an app started with [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite)'s excellent app starter CLI.

As with most apps it has no real purpose other than make its users, eh, better*er*. At things, I suspect.

## Prerequisites :banana:

- `npm i && rnpm link`

### Android :boat:

- Make sure the file  *~/.gradle/gradle.properties* contains this
```
BETTERER_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=betterer.keystore
BETTERER_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=betterer
BETTERER_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=******
BETTERER_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=******
```

### iOS :apple:

- It.. just works?

## Code Style

Because sometimes having your code style preference only in the beginning of the `README.md` just isn't quite enough.
